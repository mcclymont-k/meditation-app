              I was never very fond of sitting quietly and rarely liked to be
              doing 'nothing'. I always struggled as a child to sit and read
              books becuase my mind would wonder and I would quickly become
              restless.
              <br/><br/>In 2015, a friend of mine sat a 10 day Vipassana course
              in Auckland, New Zealand. I offered to pick him up after the
              completion of the silent retreat to help aclimiatise him back to
              the real world. When I arrived I was suprised by the modern
              facilities, the energy and feel of the property, and the looks on
              the faces of those having completed the course. I had anticiapted
              egotism and pretension but instead I found honesty and humility.
              I was immediately curious and signed up for an appropriate
              time, 3 months later.
              <br/><br/>My work, at the time, was close to the facility and I
              would regularly re-route my drive home in order to pass by and
              rekindle the sense of wonder I felt when I first visited the centre.
              I can't honestly remember what I was expecting but it was far from
               what was to come.
               <br/><br/>I arrived at the 'Dhamma Medini' in the late afternoon
               on a Friday. I had spent the day waiting in both anxiety and
               anticiaption at what was to come. I arrived earlier than most
               everyone else which is a common occurence for an anxious person.
               We were told to sign in and then return to the dinner hall for a
               light dinner and a briefing.
